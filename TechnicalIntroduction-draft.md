# Progress – Technical Introduction to Open Source

## Step by Step Guide – Being Open Source Citizents

1. Check for existing pull requests and issues. This can be tricky.
2. If it's a feature patch - check if it's in the direction of what the maintainers want. (Save yourself a lot of work)
3. Check out the CONTRIBUTE.md for how to contribute.
4. Make sure tests run before implementing.
5. If code: Match code style.
6. If bug fix: Write test first - make it fail.
7. Clean up commits (rebase).
   1. If you're doing more changes than one, have separate Pull Requests.
   2. Match commit naming style (imperative? declarative? past? present?)
8. Make a good description of what and **why**.
9. Take part in the discussion afterwords.
